# Leeds_Data_Science_Challenge
Vivienne was exploring a tropical rainforest island and discovered a new species of monkey. She observed the monkeys frequently for two years and saw that the monkeys mostly spent their time in 7 different species of tree. Unfortunately, on her voyage home, Vivienne’s paper notes about the monkeys’ behaviour were lost at sea, but she still has information about the counts of monkeys in each species, rainfall and the different tree species. She can remember that the monkeys ate the flowers, fruit and leaves on many of the trees, and they also used trees to shelter from heavier rain.
From the data Vivienne has given you, can you provide some suggestions about what the monkeys might use each tree for?
Below are some questions you could think about answering – you do not need to answer all of these. You could cover many, or produce a very in depth answer to one or two of them.
<br /> 1. Which trees do the monkeys prefer for rain shelter?
<br /> 2. Which trees do the monkeys prefer to eat the leaves of?
<br /> 3. Do the monkeys have any fruits they prefer to eat over others?
<br /> 4. Do the monkeys have any flowers they prefer to eat over others?
<br /> 5. Are there any trees that the monkeys do not seem to like the fruit of?
<br /> 6. Are there any trees that the monkeys do not seem to like the flowers of?
<br /> 7. Do the monkeys prefer leaves, fruits or flowers to eat?
